Tianshan:
Add imbalance part


Read the new balanced numpy data from the text files-newdata.txt and new newlabels.txt. Use numpy.loadtxt to use it

Aleena Scaria:
The newly added .ipynb file named "Imbalance-PreProcessing" clubs the imbalance job along with two different analysis.
There is a decision tree analysis of the data. Along with that the PCA is done both on sampled and unsampled data. And the graphs obtained for visualisation is also commited.


I've added the gene name as an array(currently of size 15). If you want to play with the size of the name array, change the size value in Data Analytics file. Alternatively, if you don't want to include the name, then just comment the concatenation line.
